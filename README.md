# guinness-calculator
A computer vision system that guides users with visual feedback as they pour a can of Guinness to giev them the perfect pour. Created as a final project for Rutgers ECE 14:332:472 Computer Vision & Robotics F2025.

Note that edited_feedback_live contains our demo code displaying visual feedback, and is a bugfixed version of feedback_live. inference_live demos real-time tracking capabilities for the angle of the can & glass as well as glass fullness %.
